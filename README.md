## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)


### Question 1

Define a method called `offerRose`, which should take one argument named person.

When called, the method should `puts`, "Would you take this rose and help out
an old beggar, X?", where X is the person passed into the method.

Demonstrate calling the method with an argument of "young prince".

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offerRose (person)
  person = "young prince"
  puts "Would you take this rose and help out an old beggar, #{person}?"
end
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
town.delete(residents: "Belle")
town.castle.new(guests: "Belle")
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends.each do |friend|
  puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
end
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 4

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
<!-- Maybe clarify whether they're meant to give relationships between all four entities or... -->
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An ERD is a tool we use to visualize and describe the data relating to the major entities that will exist in our programs.
A Lamp can have many Genies - One to many
A Person can have many pets and pet can have more than one owner (married couple or married couple with children) - Many to Many  
```

### Question 5

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. A schema is owned by a database user.
```

### Question 6

**Assume:**
1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.
<!-- Do we want to specifiy what kind of relationship they have, in case some students aren't familiar with the mythology...? -->
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.

Write code to do the following:

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby

## Sinatra / REST (meets Mulan)

### Question 7

The Chinese Emperor needs an application to help him manage his warriors.
<!-- LOLZ. YES. -->

Describe to him what a RESTful route is, and list what the seven RESTful routes
would look like for such an application.

Your description:
```
It both connects incoming HTTP requests to the code in your application’s controllers, and helps you generate URLs without having to hard-code them as strings.
```
Your routes:
GET	       index
GET	       new
POST	     create
GET	       show
GET	       edit
PUT	       update
DELETE	   destroy
```
The ancestors have provided an example of one route; you do the other six!

GET '/warriors/:id'
  * This is the show route, which finds a warrior by ID, and displays information about that warrior.
GET '/warriors'
  * This is the index route, which will show the list and display all the warriors.
GET '/warriors/new'
  * This is the new route, which will return an HTML form for creating a new warrior.
POST '/warriors'
  * This is the create route, which will return and HTML form for creating a new warrior and it will also save the warrior to the database.
GET '/warriors/:id/edit'
  * This is the edit route, which gives a form to edit but it does not save the changes to the database.
PUT '/warriors/:id'
  * This is the update route, which saves any changes to the database.
DELETE '/warriors/:id'
  * This is the destroy route, which deletes a specific warrior.

```

### Question 8

Assume:
* Warrior is an ActiveRecord model, with a 'name' attribute.
* You have a Sinatra `app.rb` (or similar file), that defines the following
route:

```ruby
get '/warriors' do
  @warriors = Warrior.all
  erb :"warriors/index"
end
```

Write what an example ERB file (aka view) might look like to list all the warriors:

Write your code here (**NOTE: syntax highlighting doesn't work for ERB in markdown files, so ignore the colors!**):
```html
<% @warrior.each do |warrior| %>
<p><%= warrior.name %></p>
<% end %>
```
