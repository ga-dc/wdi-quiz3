## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)


### Question 1

Define a method called `offerRose`, which should take one argument named person.

When called, the method should `puts`, "Would you take this rose and help out
an old beggar, X?", where X is the person passed into the method.

Demonstrate calling the method with an argument of "young prince".

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offerRose(name)
  puts "Would you take this rose and help out an old beggar, #{name}?"
end

offerRose('young prince')
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
belle = town[:residents][1]
town[:castle][:guests].push(belle)
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
 friends.each do |friend|
   puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}"
 end
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 4

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
<!-- Maybe clarify whether they're meant to give relationships between all four entities or... -->
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An Entity Relational Diagram is a way for us to model our database entities such
that we can describe what kind of attributes each entity should have, and its
relationship with the surrounding entities. It's a way to plan and structure database
tables in an application. For the four models given, we can probably say that a Lamp
 has a one to many relationship with a Genie; a Lamp has one Genie inhabiting it at
  any given time, but multiple Genies may have belonged to that Lamp (at least in
    the case of Alladin - only one Genie can inhabit a lamp at a time..iirc). A person
     to pet relationship can go either way. A person can have one pet and that pet belongs
      to a specific person. A person might also have multiple pets and those pets all
      belong to same owner; that can be a one to many relationship between person and pet.
```

### Question 5

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
  Our database may have many individual tables, and each table will have a schema
  which refers to the attributes it has (and what data types they are), relationships
  with other tables (i.e. foreign key of another table), as well as any constraints
   it may contain. It is like a blueprint or a way to describe the individual tables,
    where as an ERD is like a blueprint for all the tables and how they interact with
     each over as a whole. In the people and wishes example, we would have two separate
     database tables (people and wishes). A person may have the attributes (or columns)
      name (text), age (int), and number_of_wishes (int). The wishes table might have
       a foreign key which points to the person that owns the wish, and a wished_at_date
        (date) which would specify when a person wished this particular wish.
```

### Question 6

**Assume:**
1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.
<!-- Do we want to specifiy what kind of relationship they have, in case some students aren't familiar with the mythology...? -->
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.

Write code to do the following:

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby

  lamp = Lamp.create(:wishes_remaining 3)
  genie = Genie.create(:name "Genie")

  genie.lamp = lamp
  genie.save

  lamp.update(:wishes_remaining 1)

  Genie.create(:name "Jafar", :lamp Lamp.create(:wishes_remaining 3))

  genie.update(:lamp nil)

```

## Sinatra / REST (meets Mulan)

### Question 7

The Chinese Emperor needs an application to help him manage his warriors.
<!-- LOLZ. YES. -->

Describe to him what a RESTful route is, and list what the seven RESTful routes
would look like for such an application.

Your description:
```
A restful route is a combination of an HTTP VERB (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and
a URL path (e.g. '/mongorians' or '/CityWok'). It's a very clean and dry way of setting
up a website's different URL endpoints and allows for efficient CRUDing - ways for us
to create, read (or view), update, and delete resources.
```
Your routes:
```
The ancestors have provided an example of one route; you do the other six!

  GET '/warriors/:id'
  * This is the show route, which finds a warrior by ID, and displays information about that warrior.

  DELETE '/warriors/:id'
  * This is the delete route which finds a warrior by ID, and deletes him from the database.

  GET '/warriors/:id/edit'
  * This is the edit route which finds a warrior by ID and displays a form to update his attributes.

  PUT '/warriors/:id'
  * This is the route that updates a warrior after the updated form has been submitted.

  GET '/warriors'
  * This is the index route, which shows all the warriors.

  GET'/warriors/new'
  * This is the route to display a form that will allow us to create a new warrior.

  POST '/warriors/'
  * This is the route that gets submitted after a user fills out the form for a new warrior and hits submit.


```

### Question 8

Assume:
* Warrior is an ActiveRecord model, with a 'name' attribute.
* You have a Sinatra `app.rb` (or similar file), that defines the following
route:

```ruby
get '/warriors' do
  @warriors = Warrior.all
  erb :"warriors/index"
end
```

Write what an example ERB file (aka view) might look like to list all the warriors:

Write your code here (**NOTE: syntax highlighting doesn't work for ERB in markdown files, so ignore the colors!**):
```html

<h1>Warriors</h1>
<% @warriors.each do |warrior| %>
  <p><%= warrior.name %></p>
<% end %>

```
